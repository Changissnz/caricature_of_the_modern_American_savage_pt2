# Caricature of the Modern American Savage Pt. II 

Modern American savages exert influence in virtually all domains of geo-political 
affairs, with varying degrees. NAFTA is the center of American international 
influence, and the influence branches out from there. Modern American savagery 
and the umbrella topic of American trade are not one and the same. But in 
discourse concerning the international influence of modern American savagery, 
NAFTA makes for a good starting point because it truly is the economic domain 
of the USA that does not falter (as much) under the strains of global powers 
that do not share the same ideology. 

The modern American savage has reformed themself from previous generations. There 
is a much more pronounced display of apologism from them, for their deeds actually 
in the wrong or not, for generational faults, et cetera. This "reformation" should 
not be taken entirely as product from Protestantism's reformational split from the 
traditional Western European church (the Catholic Church). But it carries strikingly 
similar themes, at least in the rhetoric, that is something like the following. 
Issues existed in the beginning, although the best solution that was presented came 
to be the most feasible option. And there it remains as the most feasible option for 
many years, organized into tradition and such. But then, those issues compounded in 
malicious magnamity so that what became present must be fixed, no more sugarcoating. 
And for those issues to be fixed, a certain kind of politeness and class must come to 
be the representational form, which could work. But on many occasions, it does not: 
the politeness and respectability politics lend way to various kinds of do-nothing 
attitudes, silent statements of "problem is fixed, no more need for words, really". 
In short, the issues may have been nowhere near half-fixed whatsoever. Merely, the 
expression of the issues and the executions of the issues take forms that are more 
circumventing, more sinister from a face-forward perspective. 

The economic issues facing the US today can be persuasively argued as compounded 
issues. Problems are strangely worded in contradicting press pieces. For example, 
there is a labor shortage but there are also not that many jobs available. Another 
example here: there is an "industrial revolution" going on, but "we" must get back 
to the basics and "we" must remind ourselves of our roots. The "plutocrats" are 
trying to bury common citizens into debt, so "we" should really be wary of the 
"educated" types and "foreigner" types, those types that are trying to brainwash 
"us" into schlonging ourselves and giving away our belongings to foreign nations. 
"We" have lost ourselves, but instead of tending to ourselves as individuals, 
"we" should organize around common causes so as not to be deprived of capital and 
rights should "we" ever be on the wrong side of these power plays. These are class 
issues, no doubt, but the way the problems are portrayed are not too constructive, a 
cliche expectation with matters that involve "war of words": one takes the podium to appeal 
to an audience that already planned to either cheer them on or boo them down, while 
another whispers curses of damnation for their opponents under their breath. With 
economic issues such as mounting public debt, concerns over the lack of or the wrong 
kind of government regulation are very much valid. The category of "discorporatist" 
is applicable to challengers of American big business. Discorporatists and modern 
American savages, in notable positions of American big business, are oftentimes cut 
from the same cloth. Jeff Bezos, for instance, was a discorporatist when he founded 
Amazon. The reason why enterprises such as Wal-Mart and Microsoft did not immediately 
buy out Jeff Bezos is not that simple to state, although the factors of miscategorization 
of Bezos by both Microsoft and Wal-Mart on what Amazon really was cannot be discounted. 
What was Amazon? It was not a Windows copycat, it was not a proprietary version of 
Linux, and it did not have any infrastructure that could match Wal-Mart hardware, all 
of those smooth and polished products that one could not only touch but own with just 
the right amount of material capital. From a perspective, Wal-Mart was stuck in the 
Japanese perspective of production; the Japanese were computer hardware industrialists 
and did not or could not mind the software side of technological production in the 
longevity of events. Obviously, the success of Amazon forced Bezo's philosophical 
outlook into that of a new kind of corporatist, no longer a discorporatist, the renegade 
that he was in the looking back of those memories. A factor that helped Bezos to what 
he has become is that he was never really anti-corporatist. There are no records that 
indicated he joined Marxist organizations during or immediately after his collegiate 
years. Mentality matters. 

The mention of Bezos should not be interpreted as a drawing of a direct parallel 
between him and caricature of the modern American savage. The topic is on discorporatists. 
Specifically, what separates a discorporatist from any ol' modern American savage? How 
can a discorporatist compensate individuals that became out of jobs due to the 
discorporatist's politics? Not really questions that can be answered along the definition 
of abstraction. Adding in specifics would answer questions, but the clear topic would be about 
those specifics. Is Amazon's displacement of Wal-Mart in retail a clear display of their 
antagonism, although said antagonistic displacement could merely be a byproduct of their 
success? Clearly a product of modern American savages? 

Enough has been written by many in the US and abroad about "those rich people" to be evidential 
of class-based antipathy (and then somewhere along the lines, Russia and China get mentioned, 
and then where there was open discourse, there are now crickets). Shifting topics to the other 
end of the spectrum is the middle class. The middle class, benevolent because of their 
modest share of resources yet maybe just as prone to becoming if not already being modern 
American savages? From human nature, encouraged by competition and profits and social credit, 
the middle class cannot be excused, no matter the rates of its shrinkage in this "quickly 
evolving" world of labor spurred by a new kind of automation that is now the cornerstone of 
the digital age. It is about the time, specifically when a collaborator turns competitor that 
is essentially class-agnostic, hence the frequent calls to institutionalize boundaries in 
competition for power to remain as is. In defense of these statements that could be viewed 
as misanthropic, the statements are rather skeptical instead and not entirely due to pleasing 
the adage "better safe than sorry", else this article would not have been written (a misconception 
that silence is safer). 

The two-party political system of the US is a major player that both houses modern American savages 
in employment and encourages other modern American savages. The Republican Party is somewhat of an 
enigma from a global perspective. Their mascot, the elephant, brings to mind two foreign concepts: 
Hannibal Barca and the Hindu god, Ganesh. Hannibal and his war elephants. Ganesh with an elephant's 
head, a patron of the arts and sciences. The US Republican Party has supported some wars. The US 
Republican Party seems to have gone on an anti-intellectual bent within the past few decades. There 
are sure to be critics about these details about the Republican Party. The party of "the rich, the 
aristocrats" is a frequent characterization of them, but that is actually very debatable. Is the 
US Republican Party more promoting than the Democratic Party of mercenary mentalities? Also a very 
debatable question. However, it can be stated with confidence that the US Republican Party is not 
like that of, say, South Vietnam (formally, the Republic of Vietnam). South Vietnam was quite 
mercenary in its allegiance to its people and its execution of agenda. Sociology critics could say 
things such as "the Vietnamese were/are not as educated as the Chinese. The Vietnamese did not even 
have their own writing system and had to borrow from Cantonese, and then had to switch to the 
Latin-based writing system taught by the French. And that is why. It also does not help that 
Vietnamese are vassals for the Russians." The point is, though, that South Vietnam operated on unstable 
ideology. Tradition was there, sure, but faith was not. Its rulers, the Diem family, ironically came 
to represent the double-cross of geopolitics and nationalism, ironic in the context of Catholic Ngo 
Dinh Diem. The US Democratic Party is also an enigma, but arguably more so domestically than in the 
international scope. Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman were members of the Democratic Party, and are 
still emblematic of American nationalism in times of imperial challenge. Americans of the Jewish faith 
tend to be with the US Democratic Party. A political theory on why this is the case is because of the 
Jewish identity, which has historically tended to be placed at odds with majoritarian aristocrats during 
certain periods of time. The US Republican Party has been and is supportive of union-busting. With the 
likes of that stance, certain peoples such as those of the Jewish faith had to be vigilant in organization. 
An attempt to explain a motive for joining the US Democratic Party. This explanation is also persuasive 
for the case of Chinese-Americans, a demographic that is predominantly supportive of the US Democratic 
Party. A confusion about the US Democratic Party is that it is a party for the non-established, the poor, 
and immigrants. The centralized nature of control under Democratic administrations is natural under their 
federalist style. But the consensus on how that plays out for the non-established, the poor, and immigrants 
ends there. Some concerns that have been raised about the US Democratic Party is its history with slavery 
and its tendency to support legislation that stagnates certain demographics. 

Besides from business interests, the two-party political system of the US is critical to understanding individual 
modern American savages. Propensities of differing qualities between the two parties can be placed into templates 
to rationalize about modern American savages. Human beings, after all, are creatures not only of habit but also of 
identity. Maybe that is the key to understanding modern American savages, to understand all there is know about 
American business interests and the American two-party system, as well as of psychology from inheritance and 
conditioning. Lawfare, economic wars, violent wars, information wars. The price of the US staying involved is 
that the better modern American savages are put to work doing these things. And there is no better alternative.
